Yesterday I gave a talk at the [NCSU Linux Users' Group](http://lug.ncsu.edu/) and I've posted the slides and a video here. Not captured in the audio was, after the talk, an impromptu lecture about Hilbert's infinite hotel and then Jim Witschey came up to talk about the expectation of the Poisson distribution. So it was a good time!

Here's the original abstract of the talk:

> YOUR FOOD IS ALWAYS OUTSIDE OF YOU
>
> (Some Ideas About Space But Definitely Not Time)
>
> ABSTRACT:
>
> I'm going to, in an accessible way, cover some mathematical and physical ideas that I think are important or at least pretty cool. I want to talk about why orbits work, what happens in 5-D, why the World Series is slightly better than a coin toss, databases are broken forever, truth itself is wrong, and what happens if an infinite number of buses roll up at your house. Or some subset of that.
>
> I'll cover three or four discrete topics, so don't worry if you get lost; you'll be following along again in a few slides. Any equations will be supplementary only- you won't have to understand them to get the general idea.
