The other day I picked a [Mul-T-Lock Interactive](http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Mul-T-Lock_Interactive) key-in-knob cylinder that a locksmith gave me from his scrap bucket. That feels like an accomplishment to me, hence this otherwise empty post. This morning I repeated the process on video, which took about half an hour.

I have one thought to contribute: the interactive element intimidated me when I first learned about it, but I realize now it is mostly a key control feature as it does not substantially impact picking (vs a Mul-T-Lock classic).
